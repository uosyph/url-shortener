# Shorten

A URL shortener aims to solve the problem of long and cumbersome URLs by providing a simple and convenient way to shorten and manage URLs.
It includes the following features:

- User management: Users can create accounts and log in to access additional functionality, such as creating permanent or time-limited short URLs.
- Dashboard and analytics: Logged-in users will have access to a personalized dashboard where they can view analytics for their URLs and manage their shortened URLs, including click-through rates and referral sources.
- QR code generation: Users can generate QR codes for their shortened URLs for easy sharing.
- URL deletion: Logged-in users can delete their URLs if they no longer wish to keep them active.
- Limited functionality for non-logged-in users: Non-logged-in users can still use the URL shortening service, but their shortened URLs will have a lifespan of 7 days before being automatically deleted.
- User interface: The service will have a visually appealing index page and a dashboard page for logged-in users to manage their URLs and view analytics. A custom 404 page will also be implemented to handle invalid URLs.
- API: The project will also include an API that allows users to send requests and receive responses programmatically, enabling integration with other applications and services.

In summary, the URL Shortener project will provide a comprehensive solution for shortening, managing, and tracking URLs, with features to suit both logged-in and non-logged-in users.
